As I was not having android device so I changed the code a bit, instead of live streaming I used an already recorded video and do detecion on the video. For RTSP streaming i have written the code but was not having android phone to complete it, sorry for that. 
As you said you can convert already recorded video into rtsp url, I tried alot but didnt foudn any way to do that. 
For running the code you have to run the "main.py" file. The video classroom.mp4 is the video on which detection is done. 
"rtsp.py" is the file for rtsp url streaming.
Due to limited time and due to other commitments of my office, this is the task I could complete.
